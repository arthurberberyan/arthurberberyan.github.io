<p>Hello! I'm Arthur, an incoming Ph.D. student in Astronomy at the 
<a href="https://astro.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>

<p>Before beginning my doctoral studies, I earned my B.S. in Astrophysics and M.S. in Physics from <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/physics-astronomy">California State University, Northridge</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/damian.christian">Dr. Damian J. Christian</a> on the coronal heating issue and wave propagation in the Sun. I’ve also participated in the <a href="https://pccm.princeton.edu/">Princeton PRISM/PCCM REU program</a> with <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~akosmrlj/">Dr. Andrej Košmrlj</a>, where I studied acoustic metamaterials. Additionally, I have experience at <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/">Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)</a>, working with <a href="https://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/ciardi/">Dr. David R. Ciardi</a> analyzing candidate stellar hosts of exoplanets using high-resolution imaging in near-infrared adaptive optics.</p>


I also enjoy...
