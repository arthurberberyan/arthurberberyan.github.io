<p>Hello! I'm Arthur, an incoming Ph.D. student in Astronomy at the 
<a href="https://physics.ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>

<p>Before beginning my doctoral studies, I earned a B.S. in Astrophysics and an M.S. in Physics from 
<a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/physics-astronomy">California State University, Northridge</a>, 
where I worked with <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/physics-astronomy/damian-j-christian">Dr. Damian J. Christian</a> on the coronal heating problem and wave propagation in the Sun.</p>

<p>I’ve also participated in the <a href="https://pccm.princeton.edu/education/reu">Princeton PRISM/PCCM REU program</a> with 
<a href="https://kosmrlj.princeton.edu/">Dr. Andrej Košmrlj</a>, where I studied acoustic metamaterials. Additionally, I gained experience at 
<a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/">Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)</a>, working with 
<a href="https://www.nexsci.caltech.edu/personnel/ciardi.shtml">Dr. David R. Ciardi</a> to analyze candidate stellar hosts of exoplanets using high-resolution near-infrared adaptive optics imaging.</p>
