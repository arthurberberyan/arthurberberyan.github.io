    Advisor: <a href="https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/damian.christian">Dr. Damian J. Christian</a><br>
    <span>August 2021 â€“ May 2025</span>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Investigated the coronal heating problem by studying mode coupling in magnetic bright points within the different layers of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Used <code>IDL</code> with <code>bash</code> scripting to derive light curves, compute frequencies, periods, and estimate energy fluxes to identify potential wave heating mechanisms.</li>
    <li>The paper was published in <strong>August 2024</strong> (<em>woo-hoo!</em>)</li>
